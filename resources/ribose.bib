  abstract = {KEY POINTS: For individuals showing suboptimal adaptations to resistance training, manipulation of training volume is a potential measure to facilitate responses. This remains unexplored. Here, 34 untrained individuals performed contralateral resistance training with moderate and low volume for 12~weeks. Moderate volume led to larger increases in muscle cross-sectional area, strength and type II fibre-type transitions. These changes coincided with greater activation of signalling pathways controlling muscle growth and greater induction of ribosome synthesis. Out of 34 participants, thirteen displayed clear benefit of MOD on muscle hypertrophy and sixteen showed clear benefit of MOD on muscle strength gains. This coincided with greater total RNA accumulation in the early phase of the training period, suggesting that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the dose-response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy. These results demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent relationship between training volume and outcomes. On the individual level, benefits of higher training volume were associated with increased ribosomal biogenesis. ABSTRACT: Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy individuals (males n~=~16, 23.6 (4.1)~years; females n~=~18, 22.0 (1.3)~years) performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low-volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12~weeks (2-3 sessions~per week). Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and 1~h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\% versus 3.7 (3.7)\%, P~{$<~$}0.001) and strength (3.4-7.7\% difference, all P~{$<~$}0.05. This coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from Week~0 to Week~12 (MOD, -4.6 percentage points; LOW -3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6-kinase~1 (p85 S6K1(Thr412) , 19\%; p70 S6K1(Thr389) , 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6(Ser235/236) (37\%), greater rested-state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise-induced c-Myc mRNA expression (25\%; Week~2, all P~{$<~$}0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants, respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week~2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD benefit by 7.0\% (P~=~0.005) and 9.8\% (P~=~0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between dose-dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose-dependent training responses.},

  abstract = {Diabetes promotes protein synthesis to induce kidney hypertrophy and increase renal matrix proteins. Increased capacity for mRNA translation by way of ribosomal biogenesis facilitates sustained stimulation of protein synthesis. We tested the hypothesis that high glucose induces ribosomal biogenesis as indicated by an increase in rRNA synthesis in the setting of augmented protein synthesis. High glucose (30 mM) increased global protein synthesis, expression of matrix proteins, laminin γ               1               and fibronectin, and rDNA transcription in glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) compared with 5 mM glucose. High glucose induced Ser               388               phosphorylation of upstream binding factor (UBF), an rDNA transcription factor, along with increased phosphorylation of Erk and p70S6 kinase. Inactivation of Erk and p70S6 kinase either by their respective chemical inhibitors or by expression of their inactive mutant constructs blocked high-glucose-induced UBF phosphorylation. High glucose reduced nuclear content of p19ARF and promoted dissolution of inactive UBF-p19ARF complex. High glucose also promoted association of UBF with RPA194, a subunit of RNA polymerase I. Inhibition of Erk, p70S6 kinase, and UBF1 by transfecting GECs with their respective inactive mutants abolished laminin γ               1               synthesis, protein synthesis, and rDNA transcription. Renal cortex from type 1 diabetic rats and type 2 diabetic db/ db mice showed increased phosphorylation of UBF, Erk, and p70S6 kinase coinciding with renal hypertrophy and onset of matrix accumulation. Our data suggest that augmented ribosome biogenesis occurs in an UBF-dependent manner during increased protein synthesis induced by high glucose in the GECs that correlates with UBF activation and renal hypertrophy in rodents with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.},

However, whether the increase in c-Myc stimulates ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in skeletal muscles remains unknown. We found that c-Myc overexpression is sufficient to stimulate skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis without activation of mTORC1.           ,              High-intensity muscle contractions (HiMCs) are known to increase c-Myc expression that is known to stimulate ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in most cells. However, although c-Myc mRNA transcription and c-Myc mRNA translation have been shown to be upregulated following resistance exercise concomitantly with increased ribosome biogenesis, this connection has not been tested directly. We investigated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated c-Myc overexpression, with or without fasting or percutaneous electrical stimulation-induced HiMC, on ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in adult mouse skeletal muscles. AAV-mediated overexpression of c-Myc in mouse skeletal muscles for 2\,wk increased the DNA polymerase subunit POL1 mRNA, 45S-pre-rRNA, total RNA, and muscle protein synthesis without altering mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling under both ad libitum and fasted conditions. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed that c-Myc overexpression mainly regulated ribosome biogenesis-related biological processes. The protein synthesis response to c-Myc overexpression mirrored the response with HiMC. No additional effect of combining c-Myc overexpression and HiMC was observed. Our results suggest that c-Myc overexpression is sufficient to stimulate skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis without activation of mTORC1. Therefore, the HiMC-induced increase in c-Myc may contribute to ribosome biogenesis and increased protein synthesis following HiMC.

  abstract = {Loss of c-MYC is required for downregulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (rDNA) transcription by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) during granulocyte differentiation. Here, we demonstrate a robust reduction of Pol I loading onto rDNA that along with a depletion of the MYC target gene upstream binding factor (UBF) and a switch from epigenetically active to silent rDNA accompanies this MYC reduction. We hypothesized that MYC may coordinate these mechanisms via direct regulation of multiple components of the Pol I transcription apparatus. Using gene expression arrays we identified a 'regulon' of Pol I factors that are both downregulated during differentiation and reinduced in differentiated granulocytes upon activation of the MYC-ER transgene. This regulon includes the novel c-MYC target genes RRN3 and POLR1B. Although enforced MYC expression during granulocyte differentiation was sufficient to increase the number of active rRNA genes, its activation in terminally differentiated cells did not alter the active to inactive gene ratio despite increased rDNA transcription. Thus, c-MYC dynamically controls rDNA transcription during granulocytic differentiation through the orchestrated transcriptional regulation of core Pol I factors and epigenetic modulation of number of active rRNA genes.},

  abstract = {In mammals, the mechanisms regulating the number of active copies of the approximately 200 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I are unclear. We demonstrate that depletion of the transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF) leads to the stable and reversible methylation-independent silencing of rRNA genes by promoting histone H1-induced assembly of transcriptionally inactive chromatin. Chromatin remodeling is abrogated by the mutation of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase site within the high mobility group box 1 domain of UBF1, which is required for its ability to bend and loop DNA in vitro. Surprisingly, rRNA gene silencing does not reduce net rRNA synthesis as transcription from remaining active genes is increased. We also show that the active rRNA gene pool is not static but decreases during differentiation, correlating with diminished UBF expression. Thus, UBF1 levels regulate active rRNA gene chromatin during growth and differentiation.},

  abstract = {Resistance exercise training (RT) is the most effective method for increasing skeletal muscle mass in older adults; however, the amount of RT-induced muscle growth is highly variable between individuals. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others suggests ribosome biogenesis may be an important factor regulating RT-induced hypertrophy, and we hypothesized that the extent of hypertrophy is at least partly regulated by the amount of RT-induced ribosome biogenesis. To examine this, 42 older adults underwent 4 wk of RT aimed at inducing hypertrophy of the knee extensors (e.g., 2 sets of squat, leg press, and knee extension, 10-12 repetition maximums, 3 days/wk), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed pre- and post-RT. Post hoc K-means cluster analysis revealed distinct differences in type II myofiber hypertrophy among subjects. The percent change in type II myofiber size in nonresponders (Non; n = 17) was -7\%, moderate responders (Mod; n = 19) +22\%, and extreme responders (Xtr; n = 6) +83\%. Total muscle RNA increased only in Mod (+9\%, P {$<$} 0.08) and Xtr (+26\%, P {$<$} 0.01), and only Xtr increased rRNA content (+40\%, P {$<$} 0.05) and myonuclei/type II fiber (+32\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Additionally, Mod and Xtr had a greater increase in c-Myc protein levels compared with Non (e.g., approximately +350 and +250\% vs. +50\%, respectively, P {$<$} 0.05). In vitro studies showed that growth factor-induced human myotube hypertrophy is abolished when rRNA synthesis is knocked down using the Pol I-specific inhibitor CX-5461. Overall, these data implicate ribosome biogenesis as a key process regulating the extent of RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy in older adults.},

Previously, we found that serum and glucose deprivation induces KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation in the rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter and reduces rRNA transcription in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. However, the molecular mechanism and biological significance are still unclear. In the present study, we found that glucose starvation alone induced the KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription. The treatment of cells with 2-deoxy-               d               -glucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, reduced rRNA transcription and H3K36me2 in the rDNA promoter, both of which were completely dependent on KDM2A in low concentrations of 2-deoxy-               d               -glucose, that is, mild starvation conditions. The mild starvation induced these KDM2A activities through AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) but did not affect another AMPK effector of rRNA transcription, TIF-IA. In the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, the mild starvation also reduced rRNA transcription in a KDM2A-dependent manner. We detected KDM2A in breast cancer tissues irrespective of their estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status, including triple-negative cancer tissues. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, mild starvation reduced cell proliferation, and KDM2A knockdown suppressed the reduction of cell proliferation. These results suggest that under mild glucose starvation AMPK induces KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription to control cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {Using genomic microarray analysis, we sought to identify and annotate differences in the pretraining skeletal muscle transcriptomes among human subjects clustered as nonresponders (Non), modest responders (Mod), and extreme responders (Xtr) based on differential magnitudes of myofiber hypertrophy in response to progressive resistance training (RT) (Non-6 mum(2), Mod 1,111 mum(2), or Xtr 2,475 mum(2)). In prior work, we noted differences among clusters in the prevalence of myogenic stem cells prior to and during RT (35), and in the translational signaling responses to the first bout of resistance exercise (30). Here we identified remarkable differences in the pretraining transcript profiles among clusters (8,026 gene transcripts differentially expressed between Xtr and Non, 2,463 between Xtr and Mod, and 1,294 between Mod and Non). Annotated functions and networks of differentially expressed genes suggest Xtr were "primed" to respond to RT through transcriptional regulation, along with a uniquely expressed network of genes involved in skeletal muscle development, while the failed response in Non may have been driven by excessive proinflammatory signaling. Protein follow-up analysis revealed higher basal levels of acetylated histone H3 (K36) in the two responder clusters (Mod, Xtr) compared with Non, and only the responders experienced alterations in the muscle content of select proteins (e.g., alpha-tubulin, p27(kip)) in response to the first resistance exercise stimulus. Overall, the widely disparate transcriptomes identified prior to RT among the three clusters support the notion that at least some of the interindividual heterogeneity in propensity for RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy is likely predetermined.},

  abstract = {KEY POINTS: Ribosome biogenesis is the primary determinant of translational capacity, but its regulation in skeletal muscle following acute resistance exercise is poorly understood. Resistance exercise increases muscle protein synthesis acutely, and muscle mass with training, but the role of translational capacity in these processes is unclear. Here, we show that acute resistance exercise activated pathways controlling translational activity and capacity through both rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms. Transcription factor c-Myc and its downstream targets, which are known to regulate ribosome biogenesis in other cell types, were upregulated after resistance exercise in a rapamycin-independent manner and may play a role in determining translational capacity in skeletal muscle. Local inhibition of myostatin was also not affected by rapamycin and may contribute to the rapamycin-independent effects of resistance exercise. ABSTRACT: This study aimed to determine (1) the effect of acute resistance exercise on mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis, and (2) the impact of mammalian target of rapamycin on ribosome biogenesis, and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and degradation. Female F344BN rats underwent unilateral electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve to mimic resistance exercise in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. TA muscles were collected at intervals over the 36 h of exercise recovery (REx); separate groups of animals were administered rapamycin pre-exercise (REx+Rapamycin). Resistance exercise led to a prolonged (6-36 h) elevation (30-50\%) of MPS that was fully blocked by rapamycin at 6 h but only partially at 18 h. REx also altered pathways that regulate protein homeostasis and mRNA translation in a manner that was both rapamycin-sensitive (proteasome activity; phosphorylation of S6K1 and rpS6) and rapamycin-insensitive (phosphorylation of eEF2, ERK1/2 and UBF; gene expression of the myostatin target Mighty as well as c-Myc and its targets involved in ribosome biogenesis). The role of c-Myc was tested in vitro using the inhibitor 10058-F4, which, over time, decreased basal RNA and MPS in a dose-dependent manner (correlation of RNA and MPS, r(2) = 0.98), even though it had no effect on the acute stimulation of protein synthesis. In conclusion, acute resistance exercise stimulated rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms that regulate translation activity and capacity.},
