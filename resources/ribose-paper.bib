As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

	abstract = {Direct sampling of human skeletal muscle using the needle biopsy technique can facilitate insight into the biochemical and histological responses resulting from changes in exercise or feeding. However, the muscle biopsy procedure is invasive, and analyses are often expensive, which places pragmatic restraints on sample sizes. The unilateral exercise model can serve to increase statistical power and reduce the time and cost of a study. With this approach, 2 limbs of a participant are randomized to 1 of 2 treatments that can be applied almost concurrently or sequentially depending on the nature of the intervention. Similar to a typical repeated measures design, comparisons are made within participants, which increases statistical power by reducing the amount of between-person variability. A washout period is often unnecessary, reducing the time needed to complete the experiment and the influence of potential confounding variables such as habitual diet, activity, and sleep. Variations of the unilateral exercise model have been employed to investigate the influence of exercise, diet, and the interaction between the 2, on a wide range of variables including mitochondrial content, capillary density, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Like any model, unilateral exercise has some limitations: it cannot be used to study variables that potentially transfer across limbs, and it is generally limited to exercises that can be performed in pairs of treatments. Where appropriate, however, the unilateral exercise model can yield robust, well-controlled investigations of skeletal muscle responses to a wide range of interventions and conditions including exercise, dietary manipulation, and disuse or immobilization.},

In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.},

	abstract = {Protein synthesis is deemed the underpinning mechanism enhancing protein balance required for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance exercise. The current model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by resistance training states that the acute increase in the rates of protein synthesis after each bout of resistance exercise is the basis for muscle growth. Within this paradigm, each resistance exercise session would add a specific amount of muscle mass; therefore, muscle hypertrophy could be defined as the result of intermittent and short-lived increases in muscle protein synthesis rates following each resistance exercise session. Although a substantial amount of data has accumulated in the last decades regarding the acute changes in protein synthesis (or translational efficiency) following resistance exercise, considerable gaps on the mechanism of muscle growth still exist. Ribosome biogenesis and translational capacity have emerged as important mediators of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Recent advances in the field have demonstrated that skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with markers of translational capacity and long-term changes in protein synthesis under resting conditions. This review will discuss the caveats of the current model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by resistance training while proposing a working model that takes into consideration the novel data generated by independent laboratories utilizing different methodologies. It is argued, herein, that the role of protein synthesis in the current model of muscle hypertrophy warrants revisiting.},

We demonstrate that depletion of the transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF) leads to the stable and reversible methylation-independent silencing of rRNA genes by promoting histone H1–induced assembly of transcriptionally inactive chromatin. Chromatin remodeling is abrogated by the mutation of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase site within the high mobility group box 1 domain of UBF1, which is required for its ability to bend and loop DNA in vitro. Surprisingly, rRNA gene silencing does not reduce net rRNA synthesis as transcription from remaining active genes is increased. We also show that the active rRNA gene pool is not static but decreases during differentiation, correlating with diminished UBF expression. Thus, UBF1 levels regulate active rRNA gene chromatin during growth and differentiation.},

          , 
            High-intensity muscle contractions (HiMCs) are known to increase c-Myc expression that is known to stimulate ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in most cells. However, although c-Myc mRNA transcription and c-Myc mRNA translation have been shown to be upregulated following resistance exercise concomitantly with increased ribosome biogenesis, this connection has not been tested directly. We investigated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated c-Myc overexpression, with or without fasting or percutaneous electrical stimulation-induced HiMC, on ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in adult mouse skeletal muscles. AAV-mediated overexpression of c-Myc in mouse skeletal muscles for 2 wk increased the DNA polymerase subunit POL1 mRNA, 45S-pre-rRNA, total RNA, and muscle protein synthesis without altering mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling under both ad libitum and fasted conditions. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed that c-Myc overexpression mainly regulated ribosome biogenesis-related biological processes. The protein synthesis response to c-Myc overexpression mirrored the response with HiMC. No additional effect of combining c-Myc overexpression and HiMC was observed. Our results suggest that c-Myc overexpression is sufficient to stimulate skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis without activation of mTORC1. Therefore, the HiMC-induced increase in c-Myc may contribute to ribosome biogenesis and increased protein synthesis following HiMC.

	abstract = {Hypoxia induces a loss of skeletal muscle mass, but the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that hypoxia could impair skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by functional overload (Ov). To test this hypothesis, plantaris muscles were overloaded during 5, 12, and 56 days in female rats exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (5,500 m), and then, we examined the responses of specific signaling pathways involved in protein synthesis (Akt/mTOR) and breakdown (atrogenes). Hypoxia minimized the Ov-induced hypertrophy at days 5 and 12 but did not affect the hypertrophic response measured at day 56. Hypoxia early reduced the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and its downstream targets P70
              S6K
              and rpS6, but it did not affect the phosphorylation levels of Akt and 4E-BP1, in Ov muscles. The role played by specific inhibitors of mTOR, such as AMPK and hypoxia-induced factors (i.e., REDD1 and BNIP-3) was studied. REDD1 protein levels were reduced by overload and were not affected by hypoxia in Ov muscles, whereas AMPK was not activated by hypoxia. Although hypoxia significantly increased BNIP-3 mRNA levels at day 5, protein levels remained unaffected. The mRNA levels of the two atrogenes MURF1 and MAFbx were early increased by hypoxia in Ov muscles. In conclusion, hypoxia induced a transient alteration of muscle growth in this hypertrophic model, at least partly due to a specific impairment of the mTOR/P70
              S6K
              pathway, independently of Akt, by an undefined mechanism, and increased transcript levels for MURF1 and MAFbx that could contribute to stimulate the proteasomal proteolysis.},

	abstract = {The main goal of the present study was to investigate the regulation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene transcription at the onset of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Mice were subjected to functional overload of the plantaris by bilateral removal of the synergist muscles. Mechanical loading resulted in muscle hypertrophy with an increase in rRNA content. rDNA transcription, as determined by 45S pre-rRNA abundance, paralleled the increase in rRNA content and was consistent with the onset of the hypertrophic response. Increased transcription and protein expression of c-Myc and its downstream polymerase I (Pol I) regulon (POL1RB, TIF-1A, PAF53, TTF1, TAF1C) was also consistent with the increase in rRNA. Similarly, factors involved in rDNA transcription, such as the upstream binding factor and the Williams syndrome transcription factor, were induced by mechanical loading in a corresponding temporal fashion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that these factors, together with Pol I, were enriched at the rDNA promoter. This, in addition to an increase in histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation, demonstrates that mechanical loading regulates rRNA synthesis by inducing a gene expression program consisting of a Pol I regulon, together with accessory factors involved in transcription and chromatin remodeling at the rDNA promoter. Altogether, these data indicate that transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms take place in the regulation of ribosome production at the onset of muscle hypertrophy.},

              Environmental conditions control rRNA transcription. Previously, we found that serum and glucose deprivation induces KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation in the rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter and reduces rRNA transcription in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. However, the molecular mechanism and biological significance are still unclear. In the present study, we found that glucose starvation alone induced the KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription. The treatment of cells with 2-deoxy-
              d
              -glucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, reduced rRNA transcription and H3K36me2 in the rDNA promoter, both of which were completely dependent on KDM2A in low concentrations of 2-deoxy-
              d
              -glucose, that is, mild starvation conditions. The mild starvation induced these KDM2A activities through AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) but did not affect another AMPK effector of rRNA transcription, TIF-IA. In the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, the mild starvation also reduced rRNA transcription in a KDM2A-dependent manner. We detected KDM2A in breast cancer tissues irrespective of their estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status, including triple-negative cancer tissues. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, mild starvation reduced cell proliferation, and KDM2A knockdown suppressed the reduction of cell proliferation. These results suggest that under mild glucose starvation AMPK induces KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription to control cell proliferation.},

High glucose reduced nuclear content of p19ARF and promoted dissolution of inactive UBF-p19ARF complex. High glucose also promoted association of UBF with RPA194, a subunit of RNA polymerase I. Inhibition of Erk, p70S6 kinase, and UBF1 by transfecting GECs with their respective inactive mutants abolished laminin γ

Phosphorylation by AMPK impairs the interaction of TIF-IA with the TBP-containing promoter selectivity factor SL1, thereby precluding the assembly of functional transcription initiation complexes.

	abstract = {Resistance exercise training (RT) is the most effective method for increasing skeletal muscle mass in older adults; however, the amount of RT-induced muscle growth is highly variable between individuals. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others suggests ribosome biogenesis may be an important factor regulating RT-induced hypertrophy, and we hypothesized that the extent of hypertrophy is at least partly regulated by the amount of RT-induced ribosome biogenesis. To examine this, 42 older adults underwent 4 wk of RT aimed at inducing hypertrophy of the knee extensors (e.g., 2 sets of squat, leg press, and knee extension, 10–12 repetition maximums, 3 days/wk), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed pre- and post-RT. Post hoc K-means cluster analysis revealed distinct differences in type II myofiber hypertrophy among subjects. The percent change in type II myofiber size in nonresponders (Non; n = 17) was −7\%, moderate responders (Mod; n = 19) +22\%, and extreme responders (Xtr; n = 6) +83\%. Total muscle RNA increased only in Mod (+9\%, P {\textless} 0.08) and Xtr (+26\%, P {\textless} 0.01), and only Xtr increased rRNA content (+40\%, P {\textless} 0.05) and myonuclei/type II fiber (+32\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Additionally, Mod and Xtr had a greater increase in c-Myc protein levels compared with Non (e.g., approximately +350 and +250\% vs. +50\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05). In vitro studies showed that growth factor-induced human myotube hypertrophy is abolished when rRNA synthesis is knocked down using the Pol I-specific inhibitor CX-5461. Overall, these data implicate ribosome biogenesis as a key process regulating the extent of RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy in older adults.},

Transcription of rDNA by RNA Pol I is the rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, indicating in turn that this biogenesis strongly influences the hypertrophic response. The present minireview focuses on 1) a brief description of the key steps in ribosome biogenesis and the relationship of this process to skeletal muscle mass and 2) the coordination of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis for growth or atrophy, as exemplified by the intracellular AMPK and mTOR pathways.},

Two-phase break point analysis was used to determine the relationship between total protein intake and changes in fat-free mass (FFM).Results Data from 49 studies with 1863 participants showed that dietary protein supplementation significantly (all p\&lt;0.05) increased changes (means (95\% CI)) in: strength—one-repetition-maximum (2.49 kg (0.64, 4.33)), FFM (0.30 kg (0.09, 0.52)) and muscle size—muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA; 310 µm2 (51, 570)) and mid-femur CSA (7.2 mm2 (0.20, 14.30)) during periods of prolonged RET. The impact of protein supplementation on gains in FFM was reduced with increasing age (−0.01 kg (−0.02,–0.00), p=0.002) and was more effective in resistance-trained individuals (0.75 kg (0.09, 1.40), p=0.03). Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62 g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM.Summary/conclusion Dietary protein supplementation significantly enhanced changes in muscle strength and size during prolonged RET in healthy adults. Increasing age reduces and training experience increases the efficacy of protein supplementation during RET. With protein supplementation, protein intakes at amounts greater than {\textasciitilde}1.6 g/kg/day do not further contribute RET-induced gains in FFM.},

The significance of this fact has long been underappreciated, and only recently has progress been made in identifying some of the molecular bases for the heterogeneous response to exercise training. It is not only of great medical importance that some individuals do not substantially physiologically adapt to exercise training, but the study of the heterogeneity itself provides a powerful opportunity to dissect out the genetic and environmental factors that limit adaptation, directly in humans. In the following review I will discuss new developments linking genetic and transcript abundance variability to an individual's potential to improve their aerobic capacity or endurance performance or induce muscle hypertrophy. I will also comment on the idea that certain gene networks may be associated with muscle “adaptability” regardless the stimulus provided.},

              2
              ). In prior work, we noted differences among clusters in the prevalence of myogenic stem cells prior to and during RT ( 35 ), and in the translational signaling responses to the first bout of resistance exercise ( 30 ). Here we identified remarkable differences in the pretraining transcript profiles among clusters (8,026 gene transcripts differentially expressed between Xtr and Non, 2,463 between Xtr and Mod, and 1,294 between Mod and Non). Annotated functions and networks of differentially expressed genes suggest Xtr were “primed” to respond to RT through transcriptional regulation, along with a uniquely expressed network of genes involved in skeletal muscle development, while the failed response in Non may have been driven by excessive proinflammatory signaling. Protein follow-up analysis revealed higher basal levels of acetylated histone H3 (K36) in the two responder clusters (Mod, Xtr) compared with Non, and only the responders experienced alterations in the muscle content of select proteins (e.g., α-tubulin, p27
              kip
              ) in response to the first resistance exercise stimulus. Overall, the widely disparate transcriptomes identified prior to RT among the three clusters support the notion that at least some of the interindividual heterogeneity in propensity for RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy is likely predetermined.},

Eight subjects participated in 2 trials. In one (PAAC), they ingested 77.4 g CHO, 17.5 g whey protein, and 4.9 g AA 1 hr after resistance exercise. In the other (CON), 100 g CHO was ingested instead.

The net protein balance response to the mixture consisted of two components, one rapid immediate response, and a smaller delayed response about 90 min after drink, whereas in CON only a small delayed response was seen. We conclude that after resistance exercise, a mixture of whey protein, AA, and CHO stimulated muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than isoenergetic CHO alone. Further, compared to previously reported findings, the addition of protein to an AA + CHO mixture seems to extend the anabolic effect.},

A meta-analysis was performed to assess whether muscle mass measured by appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) is associated with higher mortality in older adults. Articles of interest were searched for in two databases (PudMed® and Embase®). Cohort and case-control studies reporting ASMI and mortality and enrolling community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or more were included. Nine articles were eligible and included for analysis (n = 10,028). All but one study were considered of high quality by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assessment. We calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) for ASMI between dead and living individuals during follow-up across studies. A reduced pooled ASMI in individuals who died as compared to those who survived (ASMI SMD = −0.18, CI95\% −0.23 to −0.12, REM) was found. A meta-regression was performed including ASMI SMD, grip strength SMD, body mass index (BMI), sex, study quality, method used to assess ASMI, site of study and age. BMI and ethnicity were found to significantly impact the difference in ASMI between dead and living individuals. These results reinforce the prognostic importance of assessing muscle mass in older adults.},

	abstract = {The development of sarcopenia in the elderly is associated with many potential factors and/or processes that impair the renovation and maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and strength as ageing progresses. Among them, a defect by skeletal muscle to respond to anabolic stimuli is to be considered. Common anabolic stimuli/signals in skeletal muscle are hormones (insulin, growth hormones, IGF-1, androgens, and β-agonists such epinephrine), substrates (amino acids such as protein precursors on top, but also glucose and fat, as source of energy), metabolites (such as β-agonists and HMB), various biochemical/intracellular mediators), physical exercise, neurogenic and immune-modulating factors, etc. Each of them may exhibit a reduced effect upon skeletal muscle in ageing. In this article, we overview the role of anabolic signals on muscle metabolism, as well as currently available evidence of resistance, at the skeletal muscle level, to anabolic factors, from both in vitro and in vivo studies. Some indications on how to augment the effects of anabolic signals on skeletal muscle are provided.},
